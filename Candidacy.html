		Dynamic system is a mathematical branch studying complex behavior of the nature, and it's attracting more and more attentions nowadays. All above animation gifs are examples of (continuous or discrete) dynamic system.
		Click the above animations to see the details</p>
		
		<p>
		Below are some small computer experiments I've done.

				<p> A neuron (a nerve cell) is an electrically excitable cell that 
				integrates and transmits information as part of the nervous system.
				<img src="Imgs/Neuron.jpg" align="right" /> Axons 
				are long slender projections of nerve cells that permit fast and 
				specific electrical communication with other cells over long distances. The 
				ability of nerve cells to extend and maintain these processes is critically 
				dependent on the cytoskeleton.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Microtubules and neurofilaments are both long polymers that align in parallel 
				along the long axis of the axon, forming a continuous overlapping array that 
				extends from the cell body to the axon tip. 
				<img src="Imgs/AxonTransportation.jpg" align="left" width="40%"/>
				In healthy axons, microtubules and neurofilaments align along the axon and 
				are interspersed in axonal. However, in many toxic neurodegenerative disorders 
				these two populations of polymers separate from each other, with microtubules 
				and organelles located near the long axis of the axon and neurofilaments 
				displaced to the periphery near the axonal cross-sections. For example, in 
				a sequence of <a href="http://neurofilament.osu.edu/publications/">experiments</a> 
				done by Prof. Brown's group in Ohio State University, when they apply a 
				toxic chemical called IDPN (3,3’-iminodiproprionitrile) in physiological 
				saline to adult male rats, a strong microtubule-neurofilament segregation 
				was reported. However, the segregation process is reversible, and wash-out 
				happen in hours.
				</p>

				<p>
				From the experiments above, we can ask the following questions:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> How do microtubules and neurofilaments segregate each other under 
					abnormal situations?</li>
					<li>Why does the segregation phenomena occur on a time scale of hours 
					and is reversible? </li>
					<li>How is segregation related to impairment of neurofilament transport
					 and axonal swelling?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
				To answer these questions, we need at first to construct a mathematical model.
				We offer two different modeling strategies -- <b>agent based model </b> and 
				<b>continuous model </b>. Agent based model treats every cytoskeleton (microtubule
				or neurofilament) as a "agent", and use physical laws to describe their 
				dynamics:

				<h4> <a name="SHS">3. Hybrid Methods</a> </h4>
				<p> Multiscale modelling challenges occur frequently throughout cell 
				biology and molecular biology, especially in the context of cell migration
				or cell polarization. To solve multiscale problems, both stochastic and PDE 
				modeling approaches have been well studied and in various of similar context
				in biology. </p>
				
				<p>
				Generally speaking, stochastic models are easier to parameterize, can be 
				used to integrate underlying biological phenomena, but hard to analyze 
				mathematically and can be more computational expensive. PDE models, 
				However, are amenable to mathematical analysis and computational methods 
				are well-developed. But on one hand, since various biological processes (typically 
				occurring on different time or length scales) are usually lumped together,
				it make parameters involved in PDEs difficult to obtain; On the other hand, 
				PDE models are sometimes controversial since they are not able to provide 
				all the details involved in a biological process. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Taking account all those 
				considerations above, it is important to find underline connections of different
				approaches, so that we can make better decisions on <b>WHEN</b> and <b>WHERE</b> 
				to use <b>WHICH </b> models.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We thereby propose two different approaches to study multiscale problems:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li> Using stochastic hybrid system (similar to the ideas of <a href="http://www.proba.jussieu.fr/pageperso/tankov/tankov_voltchkova.pdf"><i>
					diffusion jump process </i></a>, <a href="http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~papapan/papers/introduction.pdf"><i>
					Levy process </i></a> or <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441911049"><i>
					hybrid switching diffusions </i></a>), to see how stochastic behavior can
					be approximated by a PDE counterpart. </li>
					
					<li> Using PDE-assisted hybrid methods, to separate our problems into
					different geometric domains, and apply different strategies on each
					particular domain. This approach has been well studied in the context
					of computation. </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>More details of stochastic hybrid system can be found in the last pages
				of my <a href="Presentations/CandidacyPresentation_final.pdf">
				<i>candidacy exam presentation</i></a>, and numerical algorithm of
				hybrid methods can be found in my presentation
				<a href="Presentations/HybridMethod.pdf">
				<i>PDE-assisted hybrid methods</i></a>.</p>
