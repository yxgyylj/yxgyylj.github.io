		<p class="title"><b> Introduction -- Mathematical Modeling in Cell and Molecular Biology, and Relation to Pattern Formation</b></p>
		<p>
		A cell is the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently, and cells are often called the ”building
		blocks of life”. Cell biology is a branch of biology aimed at studying behaviors, functions, structures, and
		activities of various cells. Cell biology is evolving very rapidly nowadays, and is continuously attracting
		more and more scientists and researches with various background including mathematics, physics, computer
		science, statistics and engineering [3, 8]. Although with a great amount of effort addressed on, however, we
		are still far from a full understanding of the microscopic cellular world.</p>
		
		<p>
		Patterns, on the other hand, are universal phenomena taking place in physics, chemistry, biology, geography
		and even economics. For example, spontaneous symmetry breaking (some author also call critical
		phenomena or non-equilibrium steady states) in second-order phase transition, Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction,
		Turing’s pattern, landmark formation and economic oscillations [1, 4, 5, 7]. In the context of biology,
		there had been lots of studies on pattern formation since Alan Turing’s celebrated work on morphogenesis
		[9], which had a great influence on revolution of interdisciplinary subjects such as mathematical biology,
		biophysics and complexity science. However, most of the well-developed theories are mainly focused on
		macroscopic level biology (e.g. system level biology) so far, and benchmark results are still need in microscopic
		counterpart (cell and molecular level biology).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Inspired by these facts, my work will thus be focused on developing some theoretical and numerical
		results on pattern formation phenomena in the context of cell biology. Based on bifurcation theory as well
		as ordinary and partial differential equations, I’ll further develop theories in [4] and [7], and apply the ideas
		into some well-known experiments in cell biology.

				<p> A neuron (a nerve cell) is an electrically excitable cell that 
				integrates and transmits information as part of the nervous system.
				<img src="Files/Imgs/Candidacy/Neuron.jpg" align="right" /> Axons 
				are long slender projections of nerve cells that permit fast and 
				specific electrical communication with other cells over long distances. The 
				ability of nerve cells to extend and maintain these processes is critically 
				dependent on the cytoskeleton.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Microtubules and neurofilaments are both long polymers that align in parallel 
				along the long axis of the axon, forming a continuous overlapping array that 
				extends from the cell body to the axon tip. 
				<img src="Files/Imgs/Candidacy/AxonTransportation.jpg" align="left" width="40%"/>
				In healthy axons, microtubules and neurofilaments align along the axon and 
				are interspersed in axonal. However, in many toxic neurodegenerative disorders 
				these two populations of polymers separate from each other, with microtubules 
				and organelles located near the long axis of the axon and neurofilaments 
				displaced to the periphery near the axonal cross-sections. For example, in 
				a sequence of <a href="http://neurofilament.osu.edu/publications/">experiments</a> 
				done by Prof. Brown's group in Ohio State University, when they apply a 
				toxic chemical called IDPN (3,3’-iminodiproprionitrile) in physiological 
				saline to adult male rats, a strong microtubule-neurofilament segregation 
				was reported. However, the segregation process is reversible, and wash-out 
				happen in hours.
				</p>

				<p>
				From the experiments above, we can ask the following questions:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> How do microtubules and neurofilaments segregate each other under 
					abnormal situations?</li>
					<li>Why does the segregation phenomena occur on a time scale of hours 
					and is reversible? </li>
					<li>How is segregation related to impairment of neurofilament transport
					 and axonal swelling?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
				To answer these questions, we need at first to construct a mathematical model.
				We offer two different modeling strategies -- <b>agent based model </b> and 
				<b>continuous model </b>. Agent based model treats every cytoskeleton (microtubule
				or neurofilament) as a "agent", and use physical laws to describe their 
				dynamics:
				</p>
				
				<center><img src="Files/Imgs/Candidacy/agentBased.jpg" alt="AgentbBased Model" style="width:480px;" /></center>
				
				<p>
				which is a large system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). As a
				comparison, the continuous model takes following form:
				</p>
				
				<center><img src="Files/Imgs/Candidacy/nonlocal.jpg" alt="Nonlocal Model" style="width:480px;" /></center>
				
				<p>
				which is a coupled nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation. Different parameter
				values represent for different situations. For example, after nondimensionalization,
				 k<sub>2</sub> = 0.432 corresponds to normal case while k<sub>2</sub> = 0 
				 corresponds to IDPN-injected case. Numerical simulations indicated a significant
				 difference between these two situations, which are in accordance with experimental
				 results:

				<h4> <a name="SHS">3. Hybrid Methods</a> </h4>
				<p> Multiscale modelling challenges occur frequently throughout cell 
				biology and molecular biology, especially in the context of cell migration
				or cell polarization. To solve multiscale problems, both stochastic and PDE 
				modeling approaches have been well studied and in various of similar context
				in biology. </p>
				
				<p>
				Generally speaking, stochastic models are easier to parameterize, can be 
				used to integrate underlying biological phenomena, but hard to analyze 
				mathematically and can be more computational expensive. PDE models, 
				However, are amenable to mathematical analysis and computational methods 
				are well-developed. But on one hand, since various biological processes (typically 
				occurring on different time or length scales) are usually lumped together,
				it make parameters involved in PDEs difficult to obtain; On the other hand, 
				PDE models are sometimes controversial since they are not able to provide 
				all the details involved in a biological process. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Taking account all those 
				considerations above, it is important to find underline connections of different
				approaches, so that we can make better decisions on <b>WHEN</b> and <b>WHERE</b> 
				to use <b>WHICH </b> models.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We thereby propose two different approaches to study multiscale problems:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li> Using stochastic hybrid system (similar to the ideas of <a href="http://www.proba.jussieu.fr/pageperso/tankov/tankov_voltchkova.pdf"><i>
					diffusion jump process </i></a>, <a href="http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~papapan/papers/introduction.pdf"><i>
					Levy process </i></a> or <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441911049"><i>
					hybrid switching diffusions </i></a>), to see how stochastic behavior can
					be approximated by a PDE counterpart. </li>
					
					<li> Using PDE-assisted hybrid methods, to separate our problems into
					different geometric domains, and apply different strategies on each
					particular domain. This approach has been well studied in the context
					of computation. </li>
				</ul>
